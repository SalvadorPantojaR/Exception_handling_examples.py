# Exception_handling_examples.py

This script provides a practical example of how to write robust Python programs by handling potential runtime errors.

Features demonstrated:

File reading with error handling (FileNotFoundError, generic exceptions)

Input validation with custom exceptions (raise ValueError)

Preventing invalid operations with assertions (assert)

Catching arithmetic errors like division by zero

This project is part of my learning process in writing defensive and error-resistant code with Python.
